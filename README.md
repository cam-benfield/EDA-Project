## Purpose:
 The purpose of this project is to suggest a strategy for making the foray into movie production for the Microsoft Corporation based on data pulled from IMDB and scraped from various sources across the internet.

## Methods:
 - Data Cleaning
 - SQL Querying
 - Data Visualization

## Technologies:

 - SQLite
 - Pandas, Jupyter
 - HTML
 - BeautifulSoup
 - Google Slides

## Data Used:
 - IMDB Data Previously Provided
 - Data scraped from
## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)
